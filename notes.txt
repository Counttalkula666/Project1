* Things to add:
    * Display several houses
        * Add a filter function(cost?,duration?,distance?)
            * API call to every possible region will be too slow and zillow does not preorganize data
            * Possibly calculate the distance based on lat/long and sort the zillow returned list that way
            * Sorting by the square distance is cheaper than taking the square root
    * Time needs to be during traffic
        * Have a toggle button to change what time you want it to be (morning rush/evening rush)
    * Calculate the routes for all houses and display them on the list
        * Currently calculations are done after the call is done

    * Weather API the average daily rainfall can be taken? We can possibly have different icons for different rainfall amounts
