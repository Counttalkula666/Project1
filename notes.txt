* Things to add:
    * Display several houses
        * Add a filter function(cost?,duration?,distance?)
            * API call to every possible region will be too slow and zillow does not preorganize data
            * Possibly calculate the distance based on lat/long and sort the zillow returned list that way
            * Sorting by the square distance is cheaper than taking the square root
    * Time needs to be during traffic
        * Have a toggle button to change what time you want it to be (morning rush/evening rush)
    * Calculate the routes for all houses and display them on the list
        * Currently calculations are done after the call is done

    * Weather API the average daily rainfall can be taken? We can possibly have different icons for different rainfall amounts

*Limitations: 
    If over 10 queries are called per second google returns an errors 
        *possibly set timeout on the query calls and create a queue?

*Bugs:
    * There are lot of errors to catch while parsing the city string: 
    * XML Document needs to be manually moved the function isn't able to correctly parse the XML when there is an empty zindex
    * The google query should be callbacked if there is no matching results but without the company
    * parse the address based on that
    * try switching to ATTOM Data for real estate data

* Set the average daily rainfall breakpoints as 
    * below 2: sunny  
    * 2-3: light rain
    * 3-4: moderate
    * above 4: heavy rain
